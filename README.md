## About The Project
This calculator was developed to provide small businesses and clinics with a clear, interactive tool to understand their financial break-even point when offering multiple services or products. By inputting fixed costs, individual product revenues, variable costs, and their sales mix, users can quickly determine the number of patient visits needed to cover their expenses. It also visualizes the cost, revenue, and break-even points on a dynamic chart.
## Features
  - Detailed Fixed Expense Input: Enter various fixed costs on a monthly or annual basis.
  - Dynamic Product Management: Add and remove multiple products/services.
  - Per-Unit Cost & Revenue Tracking: Define revenue and variable costs for each product.
  - Sales Mix Allocation: Designate a primary product and set sales percentages for others.
  - Clinic Capacity Metrics: Input clinic hours and encounter time to calculate total billable visits and man-year capacity.
  - Labor Cost Calculation: Automatically calculates staff and physician labor costs per hour based on inputs.
  - Overall Break-Even Point: Displays the total units (patient visits) and revenue needed to break even.
  - Individual Product Break-Even: Shows the specific unit contribution of each product to the overall break-even.
  - Interactive Break-Even Chart: Visualizes Fixed Costs, Total Variable Costs, Total Costs, and Total Revenue relative to Patient Visits.
